I am the sole author of the entire code. Wiktor Lewicki

The bot and the engine are located in the files bot.cpp and silnik.cpp.

The graphical interface was written in QT 6.7.

Classic chess game. To play the version with a graphical interface, you need to go to the GRA/Files folder and run the Szachy.exe file.

To play the console version, compile the main.cpp file from the console version folder and run it. Controls: x1, y1, x2, y2.

As for the bot, it plays fairly well. It's a minmax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning with variable depth. However, it's known that it's difficult to write a very strong chess bot, especially on your own chess engine.
